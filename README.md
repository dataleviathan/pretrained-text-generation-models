Exploring Transformers with Pretrained Text Generation Models

**Introduction**

Transformers are deep learning models introduced in 2017 that use attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence. Unlike traditional models that process sequences step-by-step, transformers can analyze entire sequences simultaneously, enabling them to capture complex patterns in text. They are foundational to many recent breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP), including models like GPT-2, BERT, and ChatGPT.

**Experiment Summary**

I used the Hugging Face transformers library along with PyTorch to load the pre-trained GPT-2 model and generate text using the pipeline API. I tested different prompts and adjusted two main parameters: max_length (how long the output can be) and temperature (which controls randomnessâ€”lower values produce safer outputs, higher values generate more creative but less predictable text).

**Prompts Used**

"In the future, education will" (max_length=50, temperature=0.7)
"The impact of AI on the future of work" (max_length=50, temperature=0.8)
"Once upon a time, there was a kingdom" (max_length=100, temperature=0.6)

**Sample Outputs**

Output: "In the future, education will provide greater opportunities for individuals with disabilities to improve their abilities and gain a better understanding of the needs of their community," said the report."

Output: "The impact of AI on the future of work is not being felt today, according to a study published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, a journal of the American Economic Association. The study found that artificial intelligence, a computer program that can read human thinking, will have a higher negative impact on American workers than human economists."

Output: "Once upon a time, there was a kingdom called the Great One, the greatest of all, called the Great One, and he came to the earth to save the world."

**Observations**

Temperature Effects: A lower temperature (0.6) yielded more coherent but less surprising stories, while a higher temperature (0.8) introduced creative phrases but occasionally broke coherence.

Prompt Type: Open-ended narrative prompts like "Once upon a time..." generated smoother storytelling. Abstract prompts like "The impact of AI..." often sounded like summaries or news articles.

Max Length: Longer max lengths produced richer detail but occasionally led to wandering or repetitive content.

**Reflection**

This experiment showed how transformers generate human-like text by predicting one word at a time based on context. I was surprised by how realistic some sentences sounded, especially for general or familiar topics. However, limitations became clear: GPT-2 sometimes makes factual errors, introduces inconsistencies, or loses coherence in longer outputs. It also struggles with prompts requiring deep reasoning or up-to-date knowledge.

Overall, transformers like GPT-2 are powerful for creative generation and prototyping but need careful tuning and oversight in applications where accuracy matters.
